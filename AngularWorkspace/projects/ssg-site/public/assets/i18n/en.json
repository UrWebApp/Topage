Coming from a mission-critical logistics background (Foxconn, Evergreen), I understand that a lost data packet means lost cargo—a mindset perfectly aligned with Stripe’s zero-tolerance for payment failures. I don’t just integrate partners; I architect fault-tolerant adapters that survive external outages. Combining deep root-cause analysis (SQL/Logs) with a Users First approach, I am ready to translate my experience in stabilizing global supply chains to ensuring the reliability of Stripe’s money movement infrastructure."
