- Established **GitLab CI/CD pipelines** for containerized deployments across multi-region factory environments
- Build and deploy full-stack applications (Vue, Spring Boot, .NET) with **real-time monitoring dashboards** for process visualization
- Perform **Oracle database optimization** and provide data analytics support for production reporting
- Coordinate technical discussions with cross-functional teams across **Taiwan, India, and China**

### Software Engineer
**Evergreen Marine Corp.** | Taoyuan, Taiwan | Mar 2025 – Sep 2025

- Developed **Bill of Lading (B/L) APIs** in compliance with **DCSA (Digital Container Shipping Association)** standards — an industry consortium founded by the world's 9 largest ocean carriers (representing 75% of global container trade) to enable digital interoperability
- Integrated **JDBC for Oracle database** interactions and utilized **Kafka for event-driven message processing** to ensure reliable data flow
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure API design meets **logistics industry interoperability requirements**
- Worked closely with **external shipping partners** to align on technical specifications and troubleshoot integration issues

### Full-Stack Engineer
**Advantech Corp.** | Taipei, Taiwan | Nov 2023 – Mar 2025
